## Large Laravel  - how to build large and maintainable project with Laravel framework

This repo contains an example project like [goodreads](goodreads.com) site where you can rate different books and write reviews about them.
Ideas behind this project include:

 - codebase must be easy to maintain and scale
 - code must be easy to refactor
 - an IDE should provide good autocomplete with minimal setup
 - use as little magic as possible, even better to remove them at all
 - if possible, make code independent on a framework
 
 ### TODO:

 - add to readme ideas and patterns used in the project
 - deploy to Heroku
 - buy a domain for the project
 - add CI/CD
